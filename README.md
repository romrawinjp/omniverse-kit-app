# Demo Applications from Essentials of Developing Omniverse Kit Applications Course

# How to Run the App

Open any code editor. For me, I personally prefer `VSCode`. 

1. download `jin-bento_editor@105.0+main.0.06d304f0.local.windows-x86_64.release.zip`
2. (optional) rename to shorter or any name you're comfortable with
3. extract the file
4. redirect to that directory 
5. open terminal and run `.\source\apps\jin.bento_editor.bat` (for windows)

# Here is what the application looks like
